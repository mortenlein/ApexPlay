/**
 * NotificationLog rows are stored in ENGLISH on purpose: they are the record, and the stored
 * title is part of the 10-second announcement dedupe key (src/lib/discord.ts), so translating
 * them at write time would silently change how duplicate calls collapse.
 *
 * They are also shown to Norwegian crew on the marshal board. So the translation happens here,
 * at display time, keyed off the stored English title. Anything unrecognised falls through
 * unchanged — a log row is still more useful in English than not at all.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP: only the title is translated. The description is free prose composed with
 * interpolated values ("... · Round 1", "3 matches generated for 4 teams"), so it cannot be
 * looked up this way and still reads English on the board. Translating it properly means
 * storing a message key + params on NotificationLog rather than a rendered sentence — a schema
 * change, deliberately not taken close to the event. The team names in it are language-neutral
 * and the title carries the meaning, so the cost is a few English words on a staff-only feed.
