/**
 * The stable error codes the API hands back, and their canonical English text.
 *
 * Why a code at all: a JSON error body is read by two audiences with opposite needs. A log, a
 * `curl`, and 201 e2e assertions want one fixed English string; a 12-year-old on the floor wants
 * their own language. So a refusal carries both — `error` stays exactly the English sentence it
 * has always been (nothing downstream breaks, nothing becomes un-greppable), and `code` is the
 * translation key the client looks up in the `errors` namespace for the toast.
 *
 * Only refusals a *human* has to act on get a code. Most 500s are for developers and are
 * deliberately left alone — a translated stack-trace message helps nobody.
 *
 * This module is client-safe on purpose (no prisma, no next/server), because the toast layer
 * imports it too. The response helpers live in `mutation-guards.ts`.
 *
 * Keys here are exactly the keys in `messages/<locale>/errors.json`.
